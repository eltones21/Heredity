# Heredity
Uncertainty/Bayesian Network with Python

Mutated versions of the GJB2 gene are one of the leading causes of hearing impairment in newborns. Each person carries two versions of the gene, 
so each person has the potential to possess either 0, 1, or 2 copies of the hearing impairment version GJB2. Unless a person undergoes genetic 
testing, though, it’s not so easy to know how many copies of mutated GJB2 a person has.

In this code, ggiven information about people, who their parents are, and whether they have a particular observable trait (e.g. hearing loss) caused 
by a given gene, the AI will infer the probability distribution for each person’s genes, as well as the probability distribution for whether any 
person will exhibit the trait in question.
